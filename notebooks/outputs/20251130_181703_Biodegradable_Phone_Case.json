From a values alignment perspective, this aligns well with human flourishing and environmental sustainability by reducing plastic waste. However, potential harms may arise from the possibility of premature degradation, leading to reduced protection for the phone. Societal implications include a positive impact on the environment but may also disrupt traditional phone case manufacturing industries. The conceptual novelty lies in the shift towards sustainable materials and the need to balance durability with biodegradability.",
