From an ethical standpoint, it aligns with values of sustainability and environmental consciousness, promoting human flourishing by encouraging eco-friendly practices. It also enhances autonomy by providing individuals with real-time data to manage their compost effectively. However, potential harms may arise from data privacy concerns if personal information is collected through the app. Societally, this invention could lead to a positive shift towards more sustainable waste management practices, benefiting both individuals and the environment. Yet, there is a risk of widening the digital divide if access to such technology is unequal. Conceptually, this invention introduces new ethical considerations around the intersection of IoT, sustainability, and data privacy.",
