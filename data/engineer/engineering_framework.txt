Engineering Feasibility Assessment Framework

1. TECHNICAL RISK CATEGORIES
   - Electrical hazards: voltage, current, insulation
   - Mechanical failures: stress, fatigue, wear
   - Chemical risks: toxicity, reactivity, stability
   - Thermal management: heat dissipation, operating temperature
   - Software bugs: logic errors, security vulnerabilities

2. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS
   - Infrastructure requirements (power, network, facilities)
   - Supply chain dependencies (materials, components)
   - Regulatory compliance (safety standards, certifications)
   - Technical prerequisites (existing systems, compatibility)

3. FEASIBILITY METRICS
   - Manufacturing complexity (1-10 scale)
   - Material availability (readily available vs. exotic)
   - Cost to prototype ($100s, $1000s, $10000s+)
   - Time to market (months to first working prototype)
   - Scalability potential (can it be mass-produced?)

4. COMMON FAILURE MODES
   - Underestimating integration complexity
   - Ignoring edge cases and failure scenarios
   - Inadequate testing and validation
   - Poor thermal or power management
   - Insufficient safety margins

5. MITIGATION STRATEGIES
   - Redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms
   - Modular design for easier troubleshooting
   - Comprehensive testing protocols
   - Safety certifications and standards compliance
   - Iterative prototyping and validation
