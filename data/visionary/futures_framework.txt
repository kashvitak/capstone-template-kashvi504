Futures Thinking and Scenario Planning Framework

1. SCENARIO PLANNING METHODOLOGY
   - Identify driving forces (technology, society, environment, economy)
   - Determine critical uncertainties
   - Develop plausible scenarios (2-4 distinct futures)
   - Assess implications for each scenario
   - Identify robust strategies across scenarios

2. TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION CURVES
   - Innovators (2.5%): Risk-takers, early adopters
   - Early Adopters (13.5%): Opinion leaders, willing to experiment
   - Early Majority (34%): Pragmatic, need proven value
   - Late Majority (34%): Skeptical, adopt when necessary
   - Laggards (16%): Traditional, resist change

3. SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS
   - Direct impact → Immediate consequences
   - Indirect impact → Cascading effects on related systems
   - Feedback loops → Self-reinforcing or self-limiting dynamics
   - Emergent properties → Unexpected system-level behaviors
   - Tipping points → Threshold effects and phase transitions

4. LONG-TERM TRENDS (2030-2050)
   - Climate change and sustainability imperatives
   - Aging populations in developed countries
   - AI and automation transforming work
   - Decentralization vs. centralization of power
   - Biotech and human enhancement
   - Space exploration and resource extraction

5. RISK AND OPPORTUNITY PAIRS
   - Disruption risk ↔ Market creation opportunity
   - Regulatory risk ↔ First-mover advantage
   - Technology obsolescence ↔ Platform dominance
   - Social backlash ↔ Movement leadership
   - Environmental impact ↔ Sustainability leadership

6. VISIONARY QUESTIONS
   - What becomes possible in 10 years that isn't today?
   - What industries or jobs might disappear?
   - What new social norms or behaviors might emerge?
   - How might this reshape power structures?
   - What are the utopian and dystopian extremes?
