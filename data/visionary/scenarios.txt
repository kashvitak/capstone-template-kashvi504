VII. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR NEW INVENTIONS

For any innovation, consider:

1. Timing: Is the technology ready, and is the world ready for it?
2. Second-Order Effects: What happens after the obvious first consequence?
3. Winners and Losers: Who gains power, wealth? Who loses?
4. Resilience: Does this make systems more robust or more fragile?
5. Reversibility: If this is a mistake, can we undo it?
6. Trajectory: Where does this lead in 10, 20, 50 years?
7. Alternatives: What other paths achieve similar goals?
8. Existential Impact: Does this change the human condition fundamentally?
